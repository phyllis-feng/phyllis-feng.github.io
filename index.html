            <p>Hi there, I’m Phyllis.<br>
            A sophomore studying Information 
            Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, 
            I’m curious about how to design 
            effortless, accessible products with bold 
            personalities. Join me as I dive in — oh,
            and wade through some code. 
            </p>

            <h2>How I got here</h2>
            <p>Born in Tallahassee, Florida, and raised in Dayton, Ohio, I grew up 
                reading and writing with my head in the clouds. But while there 
                was much magic to be found in books, I quickly became engaged 
                with the magic in the world around me. As a layout designer for 
                my school’s magazine, I learned how the confluence of typography, 
                color, and structure could breathe life to an idea. As a student 
                journalist, I learned how to amplify others' voices through my writing, 
                while also elevating my own. <br><br>
                My foray into technology started with good ol’ AP Computer Science 
                Principles. Being a writer and a designer opened up many pathways 
                for me to make a difference; in this course, I caught a glimpse of 
                sprawling new pathways — doors opening into places where technology, 
                design, and advocacy intersected. This led me to my major, Information 
                Systems, which represents the kind of human-centric, forward-thinking 
                work I’ve always wanted to pursue.</p>
            <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
            <p>Currently, I’m a layout designer and writer for Carnegie Mellon’s 
                sole Asian-focused publication, Big Straw Magazine, as well as a 
                member of Women in IS. This summer, I’m busy with my client project 
                at re:Bloom, app development for the delivery startup Nile, brushing 
                up on some algorithms / data structures — and, of course, slogging 
                through my never-ending reading list. <br> <br>
                Speaking of books, I just finished A Tale for the Time Being by 
                Ruth Ozeki! As for TV, I’ve been watching Moon Knight from the 
                Marvel Universe — I have a soft spot for Egyptian mythology. </p>
            <h2>Some favorite things</h2>
            <p>Woodwick candles; boba and chai tea; visiting cat cafes; fluffy blankets; 
                every pasta imaginable; spicy salmon rolls; cute brunch places; 
                sunsets after storms; turning off the alarm; antics with friends; 
                Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.</p>
